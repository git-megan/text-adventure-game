# text-adventure-game
This repository is for a text-based adventure game that I created for my CS 5001 final project

## Premise
You are hiking in Marin, with two of your close friends - Martin and Robin. All of a sudden, you are surrounded by a swarm of angry killer bees. Follow the story and roll the dice to find out how you navigate this situation.
